# PowerKuy-ModMenu

A decompiled APK source code of PowerKuy's Growtopia 3.81 mod menu.
Mainly for the use of checking for stealers or malware.

# Why?

We believe that all code and apps should be allowed within view of everybody.
You are not usually knowing of the things that happen backstage.
We uncover the blinds. We also believe in the freedom of creation. Everyone has the right to use peoples creations for non profit and safe use.
PowerKuy is also using a shady indo ad website which might end up infecting devices. Here you go, i guess.

# Credit

Coding of the source goes to PowerKuy himself
Decompiling and other shit hoes to Alex and me
Github goes to alex and me

Please note that compiling this into an apk probably isnt a good idea.
Decompiling process required putting apk files through a rough disassembly process with assembly.
It is not our fault if you lose your account and/or phone. All code is written by powerkuy.

# Offsets

This source code will have offsets in lib files most likely.

And we also dont know if it was powerkuy who figured this out or genta.

# Finale

sincerely,
-nukiz and alex gamming
